# Auto-Train-Gate-open-Close
To automate the opening and closing of rail gates after a train has passed, assuring pedestrian and vehicle safety. I used two ultrasonic sensors for train detection as components. Ultrasonic sensors detect incoming trains and initiate the gate closure procedure. The Arduino Uno microcontroller is used for real-time decision-making, while the Servo Motor is used for gate actuation. The technology keeps the rail gates closed until the train has safely passed, preventing accidents. I have contributed to the safety and efficiency of railway crossings by automating rail gate operations.
